        <h1 id="char-header" >PALLAS ATHENA</h1>
        <p id="char-para" style="font-size: 150%;">
          She was the daughter of Zeus alone. No mother bore her. Full-grown and in full armor, she sprang from his head. In the earliest account of her, the Iliad, she is a fierce and ruthless battle-goddess, but elsewhere she is warlike only to defend the State and the home from outside enemies. She was pre-eminently the Goddess of the City, the protector of civilized life, of handicrafts and agriculture; the inventor of the bridle, who first tamed horses for men to use.
        </p>
        <p id="char-para" style="font-size: 150%;">
          She was Zeus’s favorite child. He trusted her to carry the awful aegis, his buckler, and his devastating weapon, the thunderbolt.
        </p>
        <p id="char-para" style="font-size: 150%;">
          The word oftenest used to describe her is “gray-eyed,” or, as it is sometimes translated, “flashing-eyed.” Of the three virgin goddesses she was the chief and was called the Maiden, Parthenos, and her temple the Parthenon. In later poetry she is the embodiment of wisdom, reason, purity.
        </p>
        <p id="char-para-bottom" style="font-size: 150%; padding-bottom: 41%;">
          Athens was her special city; the olive created by her was her tree; the owl her bird.
